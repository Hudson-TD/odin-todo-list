# odin-todo-list
The Odin Project:  Todo List

# Description

This project demonstrates my ability to use localStorage to parse/set JSON formatted data. This data is used and updated dynamically to create a standard to-do list tasks separated by "Projects". On initialization the application will be supplied with default JSON data that the user can remove/personalize, which will continue to persist in subsequent app useage.
